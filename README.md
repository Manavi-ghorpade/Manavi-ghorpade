- Added Feed Component Testing for Frontend (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/229) - I was responsible for testing the Feed component, which plays a critical role in the project's Frontend. My contribution involved writing test cases to ensure the accurate rendering of both about-to-expire and expired items.
My testing efforts ensured that the Feed component aligned with the project's requirements and consistently delivered the expected results.
- Resolved Dependabot security and update issues (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/39) - Worked closely with the development team, we collectively vetted and approved each backlogged Dependabot pull request (PR) individually to ensure that the updates didn't introduce regressions or any other issues. This contribution improves the Project's security and stability by keeping the project's dependencies up to date and mitigating potential vulnerabilities.
- Coordinated and worked with the Testing team (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/219) - I collaborated with the Testing team, reviewing their test cases and providing feedback on areas for improvement.
